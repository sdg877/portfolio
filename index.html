                Driven by a passion for learning, I ventured into Software Engineering seeking a challenge and a fresh career direction. 
                My journey began with an access course with Open University in Maths, Science, and Technology achieving a distinction (95%) amidst the 2020 lockdown. 
                Subsequently, immersing myself in coding workshops allowed me to build a passion for technology and coding. 
                Despite fracturing my dominant elbow during my Software Engineering Immersive course, I pushed through showing dedication and perseverance. 
                With two decades of experience as a confident problem solver and team player, I am now eager to showcase my skills in a Junior Full-Stack Developer role 
                to contribute to a dynamic team and continue my professional growth.
