        For Project 3, we were put into groups of three. 
        We decided we wanted to build a site that would be useful to our cohort once we finished the course so we created a job board, 
        we decided to use both an external API and to make it fully CRUD.
        <br><br>
        The brief was to create a MERN stack website which should either be fully CRUD or include an external API, we decided to use both as this would fit our plan. 
        We used the Adzuna API to pull jobs with the keywords Junior and Developer. We then coded it to allow the user to log in and save jobs, 
        the user could also update the saved jobs section to reflect where they were in the interview process.
        <br><br>
        I was responsible for pulling the data into the job cards from the external API, linking the location via Google maps, redirecting to the login page if the user tries to save a job and is not authenticated and we worked as a team on authorization and linking the API.
