    <h2>Confidential Project</h2>
    <div>
        This project was developed for a client with specialised workflow requirements and due to the confidential nature of this project, specific details about its users, data, and workflows cannot be disclosed. The application addresses highly sensitive and regulated tasks, and its design and functionality were tailored to meet the unique needs of a specialised environment. Protecting the privacy of the users and the nature of the workflows was a core priority throughout development, and descriptions here focus on the technical scope and challenges rather than specific implementation details.
        <br><br>
        The project is a comprehensive workflow management tool designed for professionals to efficiently track and support complex organisational needs and compliance workflows. With a robust architecture featuring 11 interconnected data models, this application seamlessly organizes, links, and manages data across different modules and user needs.
        <br><br>
        A central calendar system provides task views, allowing users to track and monitor compliance and support activities. A task list and activity log enable real-time updates on task statuses, while an automated scheduling system triggers specific workflows based on user-inputted dates, ensuring timely completion of critical activities according to precise legal or regulatory deadlines. The application includes a traffic light system that visually signals task progress and deadlines, enhancing ease of use and prioritization.
        <br><br>
        Several key challenges were met and overcome in this project. One involved the dynamic display of attendee and contact data within a unified table, where various data points from multiple database sources needed to be accurately retrieved and displayed in a single, editable view. Another was building a context-sensitive help system, which automatically presents users with tailored guidance and tips depending on the urgency of upcoming tasks. Additionally, the app provides users with downloadable email templates, allowing for seamless, efficient communication.
